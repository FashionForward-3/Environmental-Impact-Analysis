Project: Got Food?

There are about 7 billion people on our planet and it is increasing rapidly. By 2050, it is estimated that there will be close to 10 billion people on Earth! When considering the population growth we are experiencing, it is important to understand that the demand for food, energy and water is also increasing significantly. This brings in the idea of food sustainability. Food sustainability is grounded on the idea that future generations have access to a nutritious diet in a sustainable way. This is one of the greatest challenges we face in society currently. 

This project analyzes a dataset that contains the 43 most common foods grown across the globe and 23 columns as their respective land, water usage and carbon footprints to answer the overarching question: What types of food production should be encouraged to consume a nutritious diet in a sustainable way?
